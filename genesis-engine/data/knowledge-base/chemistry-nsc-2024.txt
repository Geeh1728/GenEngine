Grade 10 Physical Sciences: Chemistry (NSC 2024 Syllabus)

Topic: States of Matter and Phase Changes
Substance: Ethanol (C2H5OH)

Physical Properties:
- Boiling Point: 78.37°C
- Melting Point: -114.1°C
- Density: 0.789 g/cm³

Behavioral Rules:
1. Heating Phase: As environmental heat increases, the average kinetic energy of ethanol molecules increases proportional to (Heat / 10).
2. Phase Transition: When environmental heat reaches 78.37°C, the substance experiences phase transition from liquid to gas.
3. Visualization: Large bubbles form at the base of the container and rise rapidly through the liquid. Vapor opacity increases with temperature beyond the boiling point.
4. Kinetic Energy: Above boiling point, molecule velocity (KineticEnergy) is modeled as (Heat / 78.37) * 2.0.

Simulated Laboratory Guidelines:
- Use a 500ml Borosilicate beaker.
- Heat should be applied via a controlled Bunsen burner or heating mantle.
- Safety: Ethanol is highly flammable; simulations must ground this behavior in safety warnings.
