# Product Guidelines - Genesis Engine

## Design Vision
The "Genesis Engine" is intended to be a premium, immersive simulation platform. The UI should feel dynamic, responsive, and "alive".

## Interaction Patterns
- **Simulation Cards**: Interactive UI components that represent simulation rules extracted from PDFs.
- **Generative UI**: Components should be rendered dynamically based on AI model output (Genkit Generative UI).
- **Acoustic Feedback**: Every interaction (Trigger, Impact, Tension) produces physics-accurate procedural audio, synchronized across the Ghost Mesh.
- **Instrument Auto-Complete**: The OmniBar provides visual hints (🎸, 🥁, 🎷, 🎹) when users attempt to manifest musical instruments via the Universal Forge.
- **Verification**: Every user action is verified against the source PDF or scientific first principles to maintain simulation integrity.

## Visual Identity
- **Theme**: "Cyber-Zen" — Dark mode by default with vibrant accents (Logic Cyan, Creative Violet, Stability Emerald).
- **Glassmorphism**: High-performance backdrop blurs on cards and overlays.
- **Typography**: Inter (Body), Outfit (Headings), JetBrains Mono (Logic/Code).
