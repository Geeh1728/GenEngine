# Product Guidelines - Genesis Engine

## Design Vision
The "Genesis Engine" is intended to be a premium, immersive simulation platform. The UI should feel dynamic, responsive, and "alive".

## Interaction Patterns
- **Simulation Cards**: Interactive UI components that represent simulation rules extracted from PDFs.
- **Generative UI**: Components should be rendered dynamically based on AI model output (Genkit Generative UI).
- **Verification**: Every user action must be verified against the source PDF using Model Armor to maintain simulation integrity.

## Visual Identity
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default with vibrant accents.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle glass effects on cards and overlays.
- **Typography**: Inter (Body), Outfit (Headings).
