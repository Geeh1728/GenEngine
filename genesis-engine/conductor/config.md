# Project Constraints: The Platinum Protocol
1. **TDD-First:** For every track, generate the tests (Vitest) BEFORE the implementation code.
2. **Type-Safe Swarms:** All Hive agents must use Zod schemas for parallel aggregation. No `any` types allowed.
3. **Iron Shield Security:** Every API route must use the Vercel Edge Proxy or Server-Side Armor to prevent key exposure and prompt injection.
4. **Streaming Reality:** Implement incremental JSON parsing for simulation outputs to ensure 'Time-to-First-Entity' is < 2s.
5. **Waterfall Arbitrage:** Use the APEX Resilience loop to switch between Google and OpenRouter specialists based on RPD quotas and task complexity.
6. **Ghost Kernel:** All physics calculations must run in a background Worker thread via SharedArrayBuffer to maintain 60FPS UI.
7. **Acoustic Sync:** All physical primitives (Trigger, Impact, Tension) must broadcast synchronized audio events across the Ghost Mesh.
