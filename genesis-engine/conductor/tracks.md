## 🏛️ CURRENT STATE: UNIFIED AGENTIC KERNEL
The Genesis Engine has achieved the **Prometheus Protocol** goals:
1. **Scientifically Accurate:** Exact RK4 solver for chaotic systems.
2. **Multimodal:** Integrated Ears (Babel), Eyes (Vision), and Brain (Physicist).
3. **Resilient:** Socratic self-correction loops ensure zero-crash UI.
4. **Quota-Optimized:** Tiered Gemini 2.5 architecture.
